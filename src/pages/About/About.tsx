              <p>
                Chosen Girls is a heartfelt movement created to uplift, educate, and empower young women 
                to know their worth and walk boldly in their God-given identity. 
                It's a space where girls are reminded that they are loved, seen and chosen for purpose.
                THrough honest conversations, faith and support, Chosen Girls helps every girl rise withconfidence, 
                knowing she was wan never meant to blend in - she was born to stand out.  

              </p>
              <p>
                We believe that knowledge is power, and that understanding one's body is fundamental 
                to building confidence, self-esteem, and overall well-being. Too often, girls are left 
                without proper guidance about their changing bodies, leading to confusion, shame, and 
                missed opportunities for education and growth.

              <h2>Kamanga Mwele</h2>
              <p>
                Kamanga Mwele, a passionate student and women's health advocate, founded Chosen Girls 
                after witnessing the profound impact that lack of menstrual education had on girls in 
                her community. Kamanga recognized the urgent need for open, honest conversations about 
                women's health.
              </p>
              <p>
                "I remember the confusion and shame I felt as a young girl when I first got my period. 
                There was no one to talk to, no resources to turn to. I promised myself that if I ever 
                had the opportunity, I would make sure other girls didn't have to go through that 
                experience alone."
              </p>
              <p>
                Kamanga's vision extends beyond just education ‚Äì she believes in creating lasting change 
                through community engagement, family involvement, and sustainable programs that can be 
                replicated in communities nationwide.
