              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                Chosen Girls was founded in 2020 with a simple yet powerful mission: to ensure that 
                every girl has access to accurate, comprehensive health education, particularly around 
                menstrual health. What started as a small local initiative has grown into a 
                community-driven organization that has touched the lives of hundreds of girls and their families.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe that knowledge is power, and that understanding one's body is fundamental 
                to building confidence, self-esteem, and overall well-being. Too often, girls are left 
                without proper guidance about their changing bodies, leading to confusion, shame, and 
                missed opportunities for education and growth.

              <h3>Sarah Johnson</h3>
              <p>
                Sarah Johnson, a passionate educator and women's health advocate, founded Chosen Girls 
                after witnessing the profound impact that lack of menstrual education had on girls in 
                her community. With over 15 years of experience in health education and community 
                development, Sarah recognized the urgent need for open, honest conversations about 
                women's health.
              </p>
              <p>
                "I remember the confusion and shame I felt as a young girl when I first got my period. 
                There was no one to talk to, no resources to turn to. I promised myself that if I ever 
                had the opportunity, I would make sure other girls didn't have to go through that 
                experience alone."
              </p>
              <p>
                Sarah's vision extends beyond just education ‚Äì she believes in creating lasting change 
                through community engagement, family involvement, and sustainable programs that can be 
                replicated in communities worldwide.
